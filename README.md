maassql-change-monitor/mssql
=============================
Takes scripts and adds / commits them into a git repository.

Why?
======
* Other methods are not reliable
** traces can be turned off
** triggers can be disabled
* Other methods are undesirable
** don't catch everything
** result in huge space requirements
** require installations on production server
* Customization
** I wanted to decide what is important and what is not important
** I wanted to stay out of the way of production as much as possible
** I wanted to do it my way

How does it work?
==============================
* Create scripts of your database
* Run the monitor
* Monitor :
** waits until the scripts are untouched for 5 minutes
** deletes the contents of the folder : {source control main}/{instance}/{database}/
** copies the scripts to {source control main}/{instance}/{database}/
** adds the scripts to the local git repository
** commits the scripts to the local git repository, putting in the date of scripting, {datetime_scripted}

Source Scripts:
==================
* represent / are generated from a live database.
* Script folder is expected to be named a certain way.  {instance_name}_!_{database_name}_!_{datetime_scripted}_!_{some short random string}
* Could be generated by:
** MS MSSQL libraries : SSMS DMO, SMO, Larry or whatever MS is calling it these days 
** Red Gate's SQL Compare
** Another thrid party tool
** Your own custom code
* MUST be generated using the same settings everytime.  IE - if you put all your objects into 1 file for the first run, don't split them out the second run, and then expect that you will be able to effectively see what has changed.
