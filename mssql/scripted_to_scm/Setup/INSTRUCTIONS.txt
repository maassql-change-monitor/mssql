* Choose a big drive.  You will have to figure out what big means.  For me, I had 2000 + databases, that meant 225 GB.  Really, I figured that out by trial and error.

* Create folders:
** scripted_dbs - the location where the scripts of databases will be written
** scm_databases - the location where the script of databases will be copied.  The location where the git repositories will be kept.
** code_folder - the location where you will store the code which runs this processing







* Install Git for Windows
** http://git-scm.com/download/win
** https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?q=full+installer+official+git
* Install RedGate's sql compare
** http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-compare/
** You can use MS Scripting Objects or some other product.  You'll just have to make changes to the scripts as needed.


* Apache
** install apache
** To httpd.conf, add ref to git conf
** To httpd.conf, add ref to httpd_scripted_to_scm.conf
