TODO: BUG : If the app is stopped while clearing / deleting a scripted db ( After having committed that DB ), then the app is started again, the app will try to check the db in again, BUT this time, because part of the scripted db has been deleted, it will appear as if parts of the scripted db were dropped from the database.
    Possible Solutions: 
        a) ask repo for the datetime of the last snapshot checked in.  IF the snapshot has already been checked in, delete the scripted db ( snapshot )
        b) Write a lock file in the scripted db.  Delete the lock file as the very last step.  If lock file exists, don't try to check in the scripted db

TODO: The error thrown up by the app to console is terrible.  The only way to tell where the error occurred is to view the log.


TODO-BUG: If the app looks for scripted dbs and finds none it errors.
Write-Error : Property 'Name' cannot be found on this object. Make sure that it exists.

TODO-DONE: FEATURE : Right now, if no changes were made, nothing is being recorded in the GIT repo logs that no changes were observed.  When I've done this before with SVN, I would first insert a tag, then do my adds & commits.

TODO-DONE:   Change LOGGING to log to a different file every X hours.  DEFAULT = 30 minutes
